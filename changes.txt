Feb 8, 2016  v. 1.4.12
---------------------------
updated source URL for SO ontology (for 2+ years SO ontology had not been updated)


Feb 7, 2016  v. 1.4.11
---------------------------
FileParser: if incoming term name contains ';' in term name it is being split into a term name
  (the part before semicolon) and synonym(s) (the part after ';')


Jan 14, 2016  v. 1.4.10
---------------------------
DOID mapper:
  rdoTermsNotMatchingDo.txt file also exports count of annotations in RGD

  rdoTermsNotMatchingDo.txt file exports associated MESH and OMIM ids


Dec 15, 2015  v. 1.4.7
---------------------------
DOID mapper, improved: implemented RULE1 to avoid redundant assignments  of DOIDs
  if a given DO terms is matched to multiple RDO terms, we remove the child terms
  f.e. if DO term matches both [Skin Diseases] and [Skin Diseases Genetic],
       only synonym to [Skin Diseases] will be made
       because [Skin Diseases Genetic] is a child term of [Skin Diseases]
       therefore assignment of this DOID to [Skin Diseases Genetic] is redundant and confusing


Dec 9, 2015  v. 1.4.6
---------------------------
DOID mapper, initial version, done


Nov 18, 2015  v. 1.4.5
---------------------------
-FileParser: improved parsing of excluded synonyms:

Nov 3, 2015  v. 1.4.3
---------------------------
-QC: SynonymManager: fixed a bug in synonym handling causing deletions of synonyms having 2+ same words
  f.e. due to this bug, terms
    'Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Aortic Dissections' and 'Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Dissections'
    were considered identical (while they weren't) and therefore one of them was being dropped at random


Oct 13, 2015  v. 1.4.2
---------------------------
-DataLoader: protection against insertions of self-referencing dags


Oct 9, 2015  v. 1.4.1

-fixed run_single.sh script
-FileParser: added handling of source_atlas field for UBERON ontology


Aug 17, 2015  v. 1.3.63
---------------------------
TaxonConstraint module: in addition to refreshing 'only_in_taxon' and 'never_in_taxon' synonyms,
  'Not4Curation' synonyms are generated for those GO terms which violate the above loaded taxon constraints
  (f.e. if a GO term is tagged as 'only_in_taxon Bacteria', this term and all of its child terms are
        tagged as 'Not4Curation', because we do not curate bacteria, only Mammals lineage)


May 11, 2015  v. 1.3.62
---------------------------
FileParser: fixes in handling custom term relationships for RDO ontology


May 6, 2015  v. 1.3.61
---------------------------
TermStatLoader: computes stats for chinchilla, in addition to rat,mouse and human


Apr 15, 2015  v. 1.3.60
---------------------------
FileParser: handles custom term relationships for RDO ontology


Mar 24, 2015  v. 1.3.59
---------------------------
refactored TermStats calculation module
FileParser: "." synonyms, common for CHEBI, won't be loaded anymore


Feb 17, 2015  v. 1.3.58
---------------------------

   that should be excluded, were still loaded)


Feb 11, 2015  v. 1.3.57
---------------------------
QualityChecker: improved loading of RDO term names
  (if incoming RDO term name differs in case from term name in database, the term name is left as it is;
   this rule is to avoid overwriting [Muckle-Wells Syndrome] with [MUCKLE-WELLS SYNDROME]


Jan 27, 2015  v. 1.3.56
---------------------------
FileParser: ", IGNORED" synonyms when loaded have their synonym type set to NARROW


Nov 25, 2014  v. 1.3.55
---------------------------
FileParser: HP ontology: HP:0040005 properties are ignored during loading
  (they are an extended version of definition field)


Nov 21, 2014  v. 1.3.54
---------------------------
FileParser: removed downloading and parsing of files from MESH -- no longer needed


Nov 14, 2014  v. 1.3.53
---------------------------

  (incoming synonyms that are present on excluded synonyms list, won't be loaded into database)


Nov 10, 2014  v. 1.3.52
---------------------------
OboFileCreator v.1.2.2: fixed copying of RDO.obo file via data_release -- per RGDD-1008

Oct 27, 2014  v. 1.3.50
---------------------------
OboFileCreator v.1.2.1: no longer duplicate alt_id: lines are emitted (per RGDD-1001); in addition, term synonyms
   are sorted by type and name


Oct 21-22, 2014  v. 1.3.49
---------------------------
CtdMapper v.1.6.0: no longer inserts new RDO terms -- per RGDD-998
MeshDefLoader: merges definitions and synonyms with the incoming CTD terms; called from FileParser
FileParser: merges incoming CTD terms with RDO custom terms, before passing the data to QC
  note: early merging of mesh data and RDO custom terms with incoming CTD terms
      improves quality of loading immensely
   previously loading of RDO custom terms could overwrite the existing terms resulting in unnecessary term updates
     and synonyms inserts and deletions
   previously loading of MESH data could overwrite the existing terms resulting in unnecessary term updates
     and synonyms inserts and deletions
   this is no longer the case! loading is now much more stable

Oct 7, 2014  v. 1.3.48
